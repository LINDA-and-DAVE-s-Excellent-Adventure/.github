## Hi there 👋

LINDA and DAVE love to chat. DAVE is a fan of photography -- he wants to take pictures and send them to his friend, DR BOB. Unfortunately, the airwaves are too crowded for his pictures. DAVE works with LINDA to use the power of ~lasers~ to send messages back and forth. Everyone is happy!

Someday, DAVE, LINDA, and DR BOB would like to show their collection of photographs in real-time to their friends on the ground. A daunting task, surely, but nothing that a few TOADS can't fix!
